# A-UVM-verification-for-DAC-and-ADC-model-with-APB-BFM
A UVM verification with a APB BFM (Bus functional model), connected to two write-only DAC and two read-only ADC slaves. The sequence generates addresses and allows the driver to tell the BFM which slave to choose. Subsequently four monitors and scoreboards record each slaveâ€™s test results.
